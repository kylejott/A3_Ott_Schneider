- The R Markdown file to run is **A4_V4.Rmd**, this will knit to the pdf A4_V4.pdf
- Note that all.RData is crucial for our R Markdown to run
- FINAL.RData can be ignored, it was saved for safe-keeping
- You will also see our two working .bib files serving as our references for documents (main1.bib) and software (packages1.bib)
- Finally, we have two subfolders A3_V4_cache (which holds the cached information from the newspapare webscrape) and A3_V4_files which contains the output of our figures that also appear in our final pdf.
